<p>C: Hi, can you tell us your name and where you work and how you got into
Rust?</p>

<p>A: Sure. My name is Arun Kolshreshthra. I’m a software engineer at Facebook,
and that’s actually how I got into Rust. Um, when I joined Facebook, fresh
out of college, um, there was a new Rust project - a new Mercurial server
being written in Rust there. I joined Facebook’s source control team and
have been working on that server ever since the middle of last year. It’s
been really fun, and I’ve been learning a lot about the language.</p>

<p>C: Sweet! Mercurial. No one knows this, probably, other than close friends
of mine, but I really wish Mercurial had won instead of Git. So, I was
really excited to see people pushing on that. Uh, how long - you said about
a year and a half that you’ve been writing Rust?</p>

<p>A: Yeah, that’s about right.</p>

<p>C: What has been the best or most enjoyable part of that so far?</p>

<p>A: Well, what I’ve really enjoyed is being able to write systems
programming, like, just doing systems programming, in a language that has
things like algebraic data types and other features from the functional
programming world. I myself am coming from  a mixed background where I both
did a lot of systems programming and a lot of functional programming in
languages like Haskell in college, and the functional programming stuff
really appealed to me, and I always wish C and C+ + had those features, so
it’s really great getting to use them every day in my systems work.</p>

<p>C: That’s awesome. So, I know that’s an open source code base - how big is
it now?</p>

<p>A: How big is the Mononoke project, which is the uh, source control server?
I’m not actually sure what the actual lines of code are because I don’t keep
up with our git hub repo from day to day, um, not everything is open source
unfortunately, but a good chunk of it - the majority of it - is on Github.
I’d say, you know, definitely several thousand lines, probably tens of
thousands of lines, but don’t quote me on that, because I don’t actually
know. But if you search on Github you’ll find the repo and you can find out.</p>

<p>C: What, if any, have been pain points for you along the way with Rust?</p>

<p>A: So the biggest pain point has probably been, like, Facebook is definitely
a C+ + shop, as far as the back end is concerned, so all of the existing
libraries and APIs are all designed with C+ + in mind. One of my jobs has
been to write bindings to those libraries from Rust, and unfortunately,
while the binding situation in Rust is actually not bad, with tools like
bindgen to help automatically generate those bindings, it turns out when
you’re using really advanced C+ + features, like C+ + 14, and maybe even C+
+ 17 features - because Facebook always has to be on the bleeding edge after
all - bindgen falls over, and you find yourself writing all these wrappers
and shims to get everything to work, and that is a bit of a pain. I wish I
didn’t have to do that on a near daily basis, but that is my life right now.
But, the pain’s worth it to get to use Rust.</p>

<p>C: That’s, that’s fair, I think! Uh, is there anything else - any particular
standouts - of your time so far here at Rust Belt Rust, or that you’re
looking forward to?</p>

<p>A: Just interacting with the community members here at Rust Belt Rust has
been amazing. Uh, I was also at Rust Conf for earlier this year, and I found
that the community is extremely approachable and welcoming. I was really
worried, like, I’m a new grad; I barely have any industry experience. Hell,
I don’t even know what I’m talking about some of the time. Like, will I fit
in? But, like, I can talk to, like, some of the maintainers of, like, key
crates, you know? They’ll have a technical conversation with me and, like,
give me pointers and stuff, and that’s really awesome.</p>

<p>C: Awesome. Thanks so much for your time, Arun.</p>

<p>A: Yeah, thank you!</p>

                <h2>Search Tricks</h2>

                <p>
                    Prefix searches with a type followed by a colon (e.g.
                    <code>fn:</code>) to restrict the search to a given type.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Accepted types are: <code>fn</code>, <code>mod</code>,
                    <code>struct</code>, <code>enum</code>,
                    <code>trait</code>, <code>type</code>, <code>macro</code>,
                    and <code>const</code>.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Search functions by type signature (e.g.
                    <code>vec -> usize</code> or <code>* -> vec</code>)
