<span class="doccomment">/// Read the interview!</span>
<span class="doccomment">///</span>
<span class="doccomment">/// **C:** Hi, can you tell us your name and where you work and how you got into</span>
<span class="doccomment">/// Rust?</span>
<span class="doccomment">/// </span>
<span class="doccomment">/// **A:** Sure. My name is Arun Kolshreshthra. I’m a software engineer at</span>
<span class="doccomment">/// Facebook, and that’s actually how I got into Rust. Um, when I joined</span>
<span class="doccomment">/// Facebook, fresh out of college, um, there was a new Rust project - a new</span>
<span class="doccomment">/// Mercurial server being written in Rust there. I joined Facebook’s source</span>
<span class="doccomment">/// control team and have been working on that server ever since the middle of</span>
<span class="doccomment">/// last year. It’s been really fun, and I’ve been learning a lot about the</span>
<span class="doccomment">/// language.</span>
<span class="doccomment">/// </span>
<span class="doccomment">/// **C:** Sweet! Mercurial. No one knows this, probably, other than close</span>
<span class="doccomment">/// friends of mine, but I really wish Mercurial had won instead of Git. So, I</span>
<span class="doccomment">/// was really excited to see people pushing on that. Uh, how long - you said</span>
<span class="doccomment">/// about a year and a half that you’ve been writing Rust?</span>
<span class="doccomment">/// </span>
<span class="doccomment">/// **A:** Yeah, that’s about right.</span>
<span class="doccomment">/// </span>
<span class="doccomment">/// **C:** What has been the best or most enjoyable part of that so far?</span>
<span class="doccomment">/// </span>
<span class="doccomment">/// **A:** Well, what I’ve really enjoyed is being able to write systems</span>
<span class="doccomment">/// programming, like, just doing systems programming, in a language that has</span>
<span class="doccomment">/// things like algebraic data types and other features from the functional</span>
<span class="doccomment">/// programming world. I myself am coming from  a mixed background where I both</span>
<span class="doccomment">/// did a lot of systems programming and a lot of functional programming in</span>
<span class="doccomment">/// languages like Haskell in college, and the functional programming stuff</span>
<span class="doccomment">/// really appealed to me, and I always wish C and C+ + had those features, so</span>
<span class="doccomment">/// it’s really great getting to use them every day in my systems work.</span>
<span class="doccomment">/// </span>
<span class="doccomment">/// **C:** That’s awesome. So, I know that’s an open source code base - how big</span>
<span class="doccomment">/// is it now?</span>
<span class="doccomment">/// </span>
<span class="doccomment">/// **A:** How big is the Mononoke project, which is the uh, source control</span>
<span class="doccomment">/// server? I’m not actually sure what the actual lines of code are because I</span>
<span class="doccomment">/// don’t keep up with our git hub repo from day to day, um, not everything is</span>
<span class="doccomment">/// open source unfortunately, but a good chunk of it - the majority of it - is</span>
<span class="doccomment">/// on Github. I’d say, you know, definitely several thousand lines, probably</span>
<span class="doccomment">/// tens of thousands of lines, but don’t quote me on that, because I don’t</span>
<span class="doccomment">/// actually know. But if you search on Github you’ll find the repo and you can</span>
<span class="doccomment">/// find out.</span>
<span class="doccomment">/// </span>
<span class="doccomment">/// **C:** What, if any, have been pain points for you along the way with Rust?</span>
<span class="doccomment">/// </span>
<span class="doccomment">/// **A:** So the biggest pain point has probably been, like, Facebook is</span>
<span class="doccomment">/// definitely a C+ + shop, as far as the back end is concerned, so all of the</span>
<span class="doccomment">/// existing libraries and APIs are all designed with C+ + in mind. One of my</span>
<span class="doccomment">/// jobs has been to write bindings to those libraries from Rust, and</span>
<span class="doccomment">/// unfortunately, while the binding situation in Rust is actually not bad, with</span>
<span class="doccomment">/// tools like bindgen to help automatically generate those bindings, it turns</span>
<span class="doccomment">/// out when you’re using really advanced C+ + features, like C+ + 14, and maybe</span>
<span class="doccomment">/// even C++ 17 features - because Facebook always has to be on the bleeding</span>
<span class="doccomment">/// edge after all - bindgen falls over, and you find yourself writing all these</span>
<span class="doccomment">/// wrappers and shims to get everything to work, and that is a bit of a pain. I</span>
<span class="doccomment">/// wish I didn’t have to do that on a near daily basis, but that is my life</span>
<span class="doccomment">/// right now. But, the pain’s worth it to get to use Rust.</span>
<span class="doccomment">/// </span>
<span class="doccomment">/// **C:** That’s, that’s fair, I think! Uh, is there anything else - any</span>
<span class="doccomment">/// particular standouts - of your time so far here at Rust Belt Rust, or that</span>
<span class="doccomment">/// you’re looking forward to?</span>
<span class="doccomment">/// </span>
<span class="doccomment">/// **A:** Just interacting with the community members here at Rust Belt Rust</span>
<span class="doccomment">/// has been amazing. Uh, I was also at Rust Conf for earlier this year, and I</span>
<span class="doccomment">/// found that the community is extremely approachable and welcoming. I was</span>
<span class="doccomment">/// really worried, like, I’m a new grad; I barely have any industry experience.</span>
<span class="doccomment">/// Hell, I don’t even know what I’m talking about some of the time. Like, will</span>
<span class="doccomment">/// I fit in? But, like, I can talk to, like, some of the maintainers of, like,</span>
<span class="doccomment">/// key crates, you know? They’ll have a technical conversation with me and,</span>
<span class="doccomment">/// like, give me pointers and stuff, and that’s really awesome.</span>
<span class="doccomment">/// </span>
<span class="doccomment">/// **C:** Awesome. Thanks so much for your time, Arun.</span>
<span class="doccomment">/// </span>
<span class="doccomment">/// **A:** Yeah, thank you!</span>

                <h2>Search Tricks</h2>

                <p>
                    Prefix searches with a type followed by a colon (e.g.
                    <code>fn:</code>) to restrict the search to a given type.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Accepted types are: <code>fn</code>, <code>mod</code>,
                    <code>struct</code>, <code>enum</code>,
                    <code>trait</code>, <code>type</code>, <code>macro</code>,
                    and <code>const</code>.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Search functions by type signature (e.g.
                    <code>vec -> usize</code> or <code>* -> vec</code>)
