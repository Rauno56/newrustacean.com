//! Community is one of the most important parts of a programming language
//! community, or indeed *any* technical community. In this episode, I talk
//! a bit about what happens when you don't have a good community, how Rust's
//! community has done well so far, and then how to keep building a good
//! community and how to build good things *as* a community.
