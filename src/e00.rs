//! Why Are We Here?

//!   - Subject: The host, the language, and the show!
//!   - Audio:
//!       + [M4A](http://www.podtrac.com/pts/redirect.m4a/cdn.newrustacean.com/e00.m4a)

//! Today's show is pretty meta. You can skip it if you just want to start with
//! something more technical, but I thought listeners might want to know a
//! little about the origins of the show and my own background, so that's what
//! you get today. Next time, we'll be tackling the `rustdoc` command in some
//! detail.

//!
//! This is an almost-empty module: we aren't doing any fun code samples yet.
//! I included the standard "Hello, world!" example, because how could I not?
//! However, at some point in the future, there will be much more detailed code
//! samples available:
//!
//!   - in the [GitHub repository] for the show
//!   - in the show notes attached to each episode
//!
//! [GitHub repository]: //github.com/chriskrycho/newrustacean.com
//!
//! Hopefully, the result will be a pretty helpful bunch of side content along
//! with the audio of the podcast itself.

/// Prints "Hello, world!" if you import it somewhere and run it.
pub fn hello_world() {
    println!("Hello, world!");
}
