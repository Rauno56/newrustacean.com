# Meta 2: Two Milestones

Hello, I'm Chris Krycho and this is New Rustacean: a podcast about the Rust programming language and the people who use it. This is Meta Episode 2: Two Milestones.

## 2 Years and 50 Episodes

In a neat turn of events, the release of this episode marks a double milestone for the show.

First, the day I'm releasing this episode is two years and a day since I released Episode 0: Hello World. It's hard for me to believe that it's been two and a half years since Rust 1.0 happened, much less that I've been doing this for two years. (If you're curious why I didn't release this episode *on* the anniversary of the show, well, keep listening.)

Second, this is also the 50th episode of the show! So despite a bit of a hiatus late last year in the midst of a really crazy time with work and school, an average of about two episodes every month. That's a *lot* of detailed content, and I'm really delighted to see that the show continues to be useful to people picking up Rust, and I feel like, 50 episodes in, the show has found its rhythm.

Over that time, I've heard from many a listener that the show has been one of the ways they've found their way into Rust—and I couldn't be more glad, because at the end of the day, that's the main thing I have ever wanted to accomplish: more happily productive Rustaceans! To every one of you who's ever sent me a note along those lines: *thank you.* Those notes have been a huge encouragement at times when I've felt burnt out on the work it takes to make this show the way I do, or when I've felt conflicted about working on this instead of just writing some Rust.

Because one strange and surprising aspect of doing this show has been that I haven't written nearly as much Rust as many of you. No few of the people who got into Rust in part through this show are now far *more* expert in Rust than me! I only have limited time during the week, and an awful lot goes into producing a show like this. If you've watched my Lightning static site generator project, you know just *how* slowly my actual Rust code has moved. That's sad, in a way—but it's also all right by me in the end. There's a sense in which I've been able to create far more Rust code by helping *other* people learn the language than I ever could have written by myself. It's a tradeoff, but it's one I'm ultimately happy to make!

I'll add that if there was a secondary goal of mine in doing New Rustacean, it was that this podcast would inspire others to do the same kind of thing with other languages, and I learned last week that it *has*. There's a relatively new podcast, about a month old, called JavaScript to Elm, which is explicitly modeled on New Rustacean—but focused on learning Elm as a JavaScript practioner. I'm humbled; I'm amazed; and I'm *so glad* that this other show exists. But I want to add: there's no reason a podcast like this couldn't exist for Idris or Elixir or any number of other languages. In fact, I rather wish it *did*, because I'd be a faithful listener. So please, if you're learning one of those and have the itch to share what you're learning, *start that show*, and then tell me about it so I can listen and learn along with you!

### Status of the Show

As I've been thinking about these two milestones, it's occurred to me: this show is about learning the Rust programming language; but at this point it's also about more than that. So the name isn't going anywhere, and neither are the learning elements of most of the episodes. But attentive listeners will have noted that I changed up the intro a bit today, and that's here to stay: because this show is and is increasingly about not just the language but its users. About you.

Again, that doesn't really mean a change in format. It just means recognizing what the show is already doing! I'm just going to keep at the swing of things, pushing out news episodes every six weeks, with the other episodes being a mix of tutorial episodes, "Crates You Should Know" episodes, and interviews—with the occasional bonus episode or meta episode like this thrown in for good measure! Speaking of interviews, I'm *hoping*—and we'll see if I can pull this off!—to do a bunch of mini-interviews with Rustaceans at Rust Belt Rust in late October. If you're going to be there, please drop me a note and maybe, just maybe, you'll end up on the show!

### Transcripts

Another fun little tidbit I have to share—strictly speaking this is "news" but it seems like a fitting thing to note in this milestone episode—listeners (and occasionally non-listeners!) have long asked for show transcripts. Some of you may also know that the scripts for every non-interview episode are available on the GitHub repository for the show. That's not perfectly convenient however. As it turns out, Michael Gattozzi recently wrote an RFC (#1990) which proposed making it possible to use standalone Markdown documents as the documentation for a given item. The biggest use case for this is likely to be sharing the contents of README files with the root of a crate's documentation—that'll be a huge win. But it also means that, as soon as that lands on nightly Rust (which I use for the show notes so that the benchmarking examples work), I can use it to easily add transcripts to the episodes. I'll plan to just add a "Transcript" item to every episode, and link it in the show notes. I also have plans for getting transcripts of the interview episodes done! So keep your eyes open!

### Celebrate

Finally: to celebrate hitting these two milestones, I'm doing two things:

1. **I'm doing a run of New Rustacean shirts!** They're being printed through Cotton Bureau. That means they should be of extremely high quality: I've never heard of anyone having any serious complaints about them (and in fact, their shirts seem to be top notch). In general, Cotton Bureau just seems to be a pretty thoughtful company. In fact, the reason the show went out today, instead of yesterday, the actual anniversary: Cotton Bureau only does releases on weekdays. And props to them for that: people need weekends. I'm *really* glad they only do shirt launches (with the people-work that entails) during the regular work week.

	There are three shirt variants you can grab, all of them with the full New Rustacean logo—rusty crab and the words "New Rustacean"—printed on the front. One is a white unisex hoodie. The others are white and dark gray t-shirts, both available in traditional men's and women's cuts. I *think* I'm going to get the dark gray t-shirt, but honestly, I'm torn: all of these designs genuinely look amazing to me. You can see the designs in the show notes.

	I've put a link to buy the shirt in the show notes and I will also tweet it out every day the campaign is running to make it easy to find! The campaign runs for the next two weeks—so, today, September 5 through October 8. After that, the first run will be complete. The design does stay on the Cotton Bureau website, and if there's large enough demand at a later date, they will do a run again, but there's no guarantee that will ever be the case, so if you want this shirt I'd suggest getting it now!

	I've timed this partly in hopes that people will be able to get these in time to wear them to Rust Belt Rust. Fingers crossed; we'll see.

2. **I'm printing stickers!** I'm doing a mix of die-cut stickers and circular stickers. Both of those will have just the rusty crab New Rustacean logo (no words). Every sponsor of the show who wants one will get whichever of those they want mailed to them. (I'd just make them available to *everyone*, but good stickers are surprisingly expensive, and postage adds up, too! Still, if you're interested in some, let me know and we'll work something out. If nothing else, I'm happy to send you the patterns so you can print some up yourself!) I'm also going to have a bunch with me at Rust Belt Rust, and at any meetup I'm at in the future until I run out! I've included the images of the stickers in the show notes, too, so check them out.

Shirts and stickers seemed like a pretty great way to celebrate two years to me—at a minimum, *I'm* excited to have a shirt to wear for one of the days at Rust Belt Rust, and to have some stickers to distribute to people.
