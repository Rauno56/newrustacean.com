# RLS

Hello, I'm Chris Krycho, and this is the New Rustacean podcast---a 15--20 show about learning the Rust programming language. This is *Interview 4: Jonathan Turner*.

A quick word for my sponsors who get to listen to this episode all in one piece (rather than broken up into parts as in the regular show feed): I hope to make more of these special-format versions of episodes as a way to say thank you in the future. I expect I'll put this up on the main interview page once all the other parts are released, but it'll never actually be in the feed, and you'll all get it about a full month in advance. *Thanks so much for sponsoring the show!* And now, into the interview!

## Closing

Thanks to:

- Anthony Deschamps
- Christopher Giffard
- Chris Palmer
- Dan Abrams
- Daniel Collin
- Matt Rudder
- Ben Whitley
- Peter Tillemans
- Philipp Keller
- Raph Levien
- and Vesa Khailavirta

who all support the show with at least $10 a month. But thanks to *all* of you sponsorsâ€”I hope you enjoyed having this special full-length episode.
