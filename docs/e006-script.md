Modules (5m)
-------

  - Modules are the basic structural tool for organizing discrete groups of code
    in Rust.
  - They're very similar in many ways to modules in Python (though with some
    important we'll get to momentarily), and to namespaces in C++, even sharing
    the basic syntax of the latter.
