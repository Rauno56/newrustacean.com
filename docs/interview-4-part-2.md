Hello, I'm Chris Krycho, and this is the New Rustacean podcast: a show about learning the Rust Programming Language. This is Interview 4: Jonathan Turner, Part 2. In this second of three parts, we talk about Rust's role in bringing together the best parts of systems and higher-level languages, and improving the usability of Rust.

Two parts down! But if you thought there were some interesting tidbits in this second part, just wait for the finale, when Jonathan throws some *amazing* ideas out there for the future of Rust tooling:
