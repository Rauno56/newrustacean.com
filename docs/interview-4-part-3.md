Hello, I'm Chris Krycho, and this is the New Rustacean podcast, a show about the Rust programming language. This is Interview 4, Part 3: Jonathan Turner.
In this final part of the interview, Jonathan and I talk about future work on the Rust Language Server, on improvements to the Rust language itself, and a bit about Servo. So let's get back into it!

So that wraps up a fantastic interview. I'm looking forward to diving back into our teaching episodes (and being back on a more even schedule: the last month has been a whirlwind of travel and house-buying and more).
